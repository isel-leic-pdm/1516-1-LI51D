/**
 * Contract that specifies a programmatic interface for accessing the weather API.
 *
 * <p>This interface is annotated with <a href="http://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a>
 * annotations and it uses {@link Call} as a return type. If the remainder of the application's
 * codebase depends directly of this contract, we create a pervasive dependency to this library.
 * When developing software solutions one must consider this consequence carefully. Third-party
 * dependencies may become a liability.</p>
 *
 * <p>In our case, and because we are having fun, we will not address this problem. But consider
 * this: what would be required to contain dependencies from our codebase to this library? </p>
 *
 * <p>Instead of using constant static fields for specifying the strings used in the annotations,
 * which is usually a good practice, we use the string literals, which in this case increases
 * readability.</p>
